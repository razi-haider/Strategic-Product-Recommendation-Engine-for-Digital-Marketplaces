# Strategic Product Recommendation Engine for Digital Marketplaces
### Project by Razi Haider

## Recommendation System Overview
A well-developed recommendation system enhances the shopping experience on a website, leading to improved customer acquisition and retention.

The recommendation system is structured into three components, tailored to different stages of the customer's journey:

### Part I: Popularity-Based Recommendations
For new customers, the system suggests the most popular products on the website.

### Part II: Collaborative Filtering
For returning customers, the system utilizes purchase history and user ratings to recommend products similar to those previously bought.

### Part III: Initial Setup Recommendations
For e-commerce websites without product ratings, the system initially recommends top-selling products.

Initially, new visitors are presented with popular items. After making a purchase, the system updates recommendations based on the customerâ€™s purchase history and ratings from similar users, employing collaborative filtering techniques.

## Recommendation System - Part I

### Popularity-Based Recommendation for New Customers

A popularity-based recommendation system is highly effective for engaging new customers by showcasing the most popular products available on a business's website. This approach is especially valuable for initiating a recommendation engine during the cold start phase.

## Recommendation System - Part II

### Model-Based Collaborative Filtering System

This system recommends items based on a user's purchase history and the similarity of ratings from other users who have purchased similar products. The model-based collaborative filtering approach is chosen for its ability to predict products for individual users by identifying patterns from multiple users' preferences.

## Recommendation System - Part III

### Initial Setup Recommendations
For businesses lacking user-item purchase history, a search engine-based recommendation system can be implemented. Recommendations can be generated by analyzing and clustering product descriptions textually.

## Summary

The Initial Setup Recommendations approach is ideal for businesses launching an e-commerce site without any initial user-item purchase or rating history. It offers relevant recommendations to users from the beginning. As the site gathers purchase history, the recommendation engine can transition to model-based collaborative filtering techniques for enhanced recommendations.
